# WeatherStation
Final exam extra credit project completed as a part of the CS 101 course at my university

The WeatherStation project is an application of the Observer design pattern. It scrapes weather.gov to obtain weather data
for a particular location, stores that data, and updates dependent classes whenever the weather changes.
